
Question Title: "Fruit Salad Cipher Challenge"


Description:

You intercepted a confidential message encrypted with AES, but the key and IV used for encryption have been securely stored by the sender. Can you decrypt the message and reveal the hidden flag?

Challenge:

You are given the following encrypted message in hexadecimal format:
 0d1c0cbc0951ada8c5c0ae691d57ab38fff1aaaec6e005982ced4fcf6005ae306d31b50bf06aac104b3e9170deca17f1

Additionally, the sender provided the following information:

The encryption key (256 bits) and IV (128 bits) used for encryption were generated using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG).

The key is derived from a secret passphrase using a key derivation function (KDF) based on SHA-256. Simultaneously, the IV is derived by concatenating the passphrase in reverse order. This ensures a secure encryption scheme where both the key and IV are uniquely derived from the passphrase, adding an additional layer of cryptographic strength to the security of the system.

The secret passphrase is a combination of two words, each selected randomly from the following list file Fruit_Salad.txt

Your Task:

Write a Python script to brute-force the passphrase and decrypt the message.
Find the correct passphrase and use it to decrypt the message.
Submit the decrypted message, which is the flag.
