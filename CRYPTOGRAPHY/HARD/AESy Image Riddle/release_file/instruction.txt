
title : AESy Image Riddle

Can you help me retrieve my image? The image is stored in a PNG file, but it's encrypted using AES encryption. There's a Python file that serves as a tool for image encryption and decryption. AES encryption requires a key for decryption, which is the same key used during encryption. Unfortunately, I can't remember the password. I've tried using the provided password, but it still won't decrypt. I don't know why...
