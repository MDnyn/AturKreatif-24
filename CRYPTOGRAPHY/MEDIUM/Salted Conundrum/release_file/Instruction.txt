title: Salted Conundrum

You've intercepted a file encrypted with a symmetric encryption algorithm. Your task is to decrypt the message and find the hidden flag.

Salted.txt contains:

Salted__£íÉ\äìõ¢œ1”'«VsRo
°(ƒÀ‚z5ðy§Àx…¯í9+ëöv·GÌ4Üê/‰¼

The encryption was performed using a common cryptographic tool with AES encryption in CBC mode and a known passphrase (Passphrase.txt)

The encrypted message utilizes symmetric encryption, meaning it requires the same passphrase used during encryption.
