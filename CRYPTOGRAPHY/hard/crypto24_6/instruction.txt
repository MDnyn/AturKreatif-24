
Question Title: "Fruit Salad Cipher Challenge"


Description:

You intercepted a confidential message encrypted with AES, but the key and IV used for encryption have been securely stored by the sender. Can you decrypt the message and reveal the hidden flag?

Challenge:

You are given the following encrypted message in hexadecimal format:
7ff5d6d671fea3d8a7cf283b4d047480240f849db01e43100a9abb90c00b33aa

Additionally, the sender provided the following information:

The encryption key (256 bits) and IV (128 bits) used for encryption were generated using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG).

The key and IV were derived from a secret passphrase using a key derivation function (KDF) based on SHA-256.

The secret passphrase is a combination of two words, each selected randomly from the following list file fruity.txt

Your Task:

Write a Python script to brute-force the passphrase and decrypt the message.
Find the correct passphrase and use it to decrypt the message.
Submit the decrypted message, which is the flag.
